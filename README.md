Ransomware Attacks
Overview
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. It is a subset of malware where the data on a victim's computer is locked, typically by encryption, and payment is demanded before the ransomed data is decrypted or access is returned to the victim.

How Ransomware Works:

    Infection: Ransomware can be introduced to a system through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software.
    Encryption: Once activated, the ransomware encrypts files on the infected system using complex encryption algorithms.
    Ransom Demand: A ransom note is displayed, instructing the victim to pay a specified amount, often in cryptocurrency, to receive a decryption key.
    Decryption: Upon payment, if the attackers are honest, the decryption key is provided to the victim to unlock their files. However, there is no guarantee that the attackers will provide the key.

    
Prevention Measures:

    Regular Backups: Maintain regular backups of important data on offline storage or cloud services. Ensure backups are not connected to the network to prevent ransomware from encrypting them as well.
    Update and Patch Systems: Keep all software up to date with the latest security patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
    Email Security: Use email filtering to block malicious attachments and links. Train users to recognize and report phishing emails.
    Anti-Malware Tools: Employ reputable anti-malware and antivirus software to detect and block ransomware.
    Access Controls: Limit user permissions and enforce the principle of least privilege to reduce the potential impact of ransomware.

    
Response to an Attack:

    Isolate the Infection: Immediately disconnect the infected system from the network to prevent the ransomware from spreading.
    Identify the Ransomware: Determine the type of ransomware involved. This can help in finding potential decryption tools or solutions.
    Report the Attack: Report the incident to relevant authorities and cybersecurity organizations for assistance and tracking.
    Evaluate Options: Consider all options before deciding whether to pay the ransom. Consult with cybersecurity experts for advice.
    Restore from Backup: If possible, restore data from clean backups. Ensure the system is free of ransomware before restoring.



Implementing the Antimalware tools,emailsecurity,update and patch systems is a complex and it requries higher expertize and skilled team to build it.
In a  simple way to defend this attack is to regular backup and restore management.



Implementing the backup and restore management using Python code with Google Drive API:

To backup files and folders to Google Drive using Python, you can utilize the Google Drive API. Below, are the steps to integrate Google Drive API :

Set up Google Drive API:

    Go to the Google API Console.
    Create a new project.
    Enable the Google Drive API for your project.
    Create credentials for a service account and download the JSON file containing your credentials.

On a brief Note::
Go to the Google API Console:



Open your web browser and go to the Google API Console.
Sign in with your Google account if you haven't already.
Create a New Project:

Click on the project dropdown menu at the top of the page.
Select "New Project" from the dropdown menu.
Enter a name for your project and click on the "Create" button.
Wait for the project to be created. Once created, you will be redirected to the project dashboard.
Enable the Google Drive API:

In the sidebar menu on the left, click on "Library".
Search for "Google Drive API" using the search bar.
Click on "Google Drive API" from the search results.
Click on the "Enable" button to enable the API for your project.
Create Credentials:

After enabling the API, navigate to the "Credentials" tab from the sidebar menu.
Click on the "Create credentials" dropdown and select "Service account".
Fill out the required fields such as Service account name and Role.
Optionally, you can grant additional permissions to the service account if needed.
Click on the "Continue" button.
In the next step, you can skip adding users to the service account and click on the "Done" button.
Your service account will be created, and you will be redirected to the "Credentials" page.
Find your newly created service account in the "Service accounts" section.
Click on the three dots menu next to your service account and select "Manage keys".
Click on "Add key" and choose "Create new key".
Select the key type as JSON and click on the "Create" button.
The JSON file containing your credentials will be downloaded to your computer. Keep this file secure, as it contains sensitive information.







Description of the Code
This script uploads files from a local folder on your computer to a specific folder in Google Drive. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:
1.	Setup and Initialization:

    o	Defines the local folder path (D:\\global) and the Google Drive folder ID where the files will be uploaded.
    o	Imports necessary libraries for interacting with the Google Drive API and handling file operations.
3.	Authentication with Google Drive:

    o	Defines a function authenticate_google_drive() to handle the authentication process.
    o	The function checks if a token file (token.pickle) exists to use previously stored credentials.
    o	If not, it initiates a new authentication flow using a client secrets file (client_secret.json).
    o	The credentials are saved in token.pickle for future use.
5.	Checking Existing Files in Google Drive:

    o	Defines a function get_existing_files(service) that retrieves the list of files already present in the specified Google Drive folder.
    o	This helps avoid uploading duplicate files.
7.	Uploading Files:

    o	Defines a function upload_files() that handles the uploading process.
    o	Authenticates with Google Drive using the authenticate_google_drive() function.
    o	Gets the list of existing files in the Google Drive folder.
    o	Iterates through the local folder, and for each file, checks if it is already present in Google Drive.
    o	If the file is not already present, it uploads the file to the specified Google Drive folder and prints a confirmation message.
    o	If the file is already present, it prints a message stating that the file already exists.
9.	Main Execution:
   
    o	The script runs the upload_files() function when executed.



   
Usage


    1.	Ensure you have a client_secret.json file for Google Drive API authentication.
    
    2.	Place the script in a suitable location on your computer.
    
    3.	Update the local_folder_path and google_drive_folder_id variables with your actual folder path and Google Drive folder ID.
    
    4.	Run the script. It will upload all files from the specified local folder to the specified Google Drive folder, avoiding duplicates.
